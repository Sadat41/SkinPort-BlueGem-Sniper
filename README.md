# SkinPort BlueGem Sniper

A **Discord bot integration** that actively monitors the SkinPort marketplace for **Case Hardened and Heat Treated knife and weapon finishes**.

---

##  Overview

This bot connects to the **SkinPort WebSocket** to access the **Sale Feed (Live)** and actively scans for any listings featuring **Case Hardened** or **Heat Treated finishes**. It evaluates the pattern of these items, and if a match is found, it sends a detailed notification directly to a Discord server. 

This makes it an essential tool for traders looking for rare patterns such as **Blue Gems**. The project utilizes `discord.py` for seamless Discord integration.

*It's not up to date at the moment. Some features may not work.
